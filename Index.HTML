            <h1> My Favorite Hobby</h1>
            <p> My favorite hobby is Playing games. I like to play games such as minecraft. I play for about 2 hours a day. I mostly mindlessly repeat the same task for an hour straight, or I find ways to get slight increases in meaningless numbers. 100% of the time i play is spent on procrasinating on nothing.Here, I will be focusing on the game Minecraft.</p>

                <h1> Why This Hobby is so popular</h1>
                <p>Gaming is fun because it can relieve stress and take your mind off of stressful things. Minecraft is a sandbox game that is mostly peaceful. Fom the soothing music to the pride you feel when completing the game, Minecraft is a extremely peaceful game, depending on how you play.</p>
